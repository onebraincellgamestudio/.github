# One Brain Cell Game Studios

Indie Gamedev studio from Braga, Portugal, moving between Barcelos and Vila Verde.
The goal is to establish a small game studio where we develop fun games that mean something to people.

We will be sharing open-source projects here on GitHub that will benefit the Gamedev community.
We believe in sharing our progress for the betterment of society and doing things to help our local community(ies).

Yes, we are aware that trusting companies to do something good is... Complicated. We'll let our actions speak for themselves.
